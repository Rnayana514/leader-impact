                A. A Serious Problem</u><br>
                Rajendra’s life had been characterized by years of immorality and rebellion against God. After receiving Christ,
he experienced many highs and lows. He often felt deep guilt as he reflected on his past. Doubts would often
multiply and he would wonder if Christ had really come into his life or if he had really been forgiven.
Gradually, he stopped all attempts to cultivate his relationship with God. He became convinced that the
abundant life in John 10:10 was only meant for special people. He finally lived in fear of what God would do to
him if he continued to fall back into doing things he knew were wrong.<br><br>
* What was this man’s problem? How do you think God felt as He watched this man in his situation?<br>

              1. What can inhibit our relationship with God?<hr>
              2. How would you define “sin”?<hr>
              3. On what basis did we first come to Christ and what was our condition like at that time?<br><br>
              And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of
disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh
and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. Ephesians 2:1-3
But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in
our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ ... For by grace you have been saved through faith; and
that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast.
Ephesians 2:4-5,8-9<hr>
4. What did Christ do with our sin (Colossians 2:13,14)?<br><br>
And when you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive
together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, having cancelled out the certificate of debt
consisting of decrees against us and which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed
it to the cross. Colossians 2:13-14<hr>
5. How many of your sins were in the future when Christ died? What things in Romans 5:8-11
pertain to our relationship to God in the past - in the present - and in the future?<br><br>
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much
more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.
For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having
been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. Romans 5:8-11<hr>
6. What are some things that Hebrews 10:10-14 say about Christ’s death on the cross?<br><br>
By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every
priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away
sins; but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,
waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. For by one
offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. Hebrews 10:10-14<hr>
7. What would you say to someone who lives with guilt and great fear of God’s judgement?
What would you say to someone who continues on in sin, thinking that because of God’s love
and forgiveness it doesn’t really matter how he lives?<br><br>
"My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by Him; for those
whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives." It is for discipline that
you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? But if
you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not
sons. Hebrews 12:5-8<br>
All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it,
afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. Hebrews 12:11<hr>

              1. What happened to David before and after he confessed his sin?<br>
Why should we be motivated from Psalm 32 to confess our sin?<br><br>
How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered! How blessed is the man to whom the
LORD does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit! When I kept silent about my sin, my body
wasted away Through my groaning all day long. For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was
drained away as with the fever heat of summer. Selah. I acknowledged my sin to Thee, And my iniquity I did not
hide; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"; And Thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin.
Psalms 32:1-5<hr>
2. What needs to happen when we realize we have sinned (I John 1:9)?<br><br>
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9<hr>
3. The following three elements are essential to the concept of true “confession”:<br><br>
<p><b>a Call sin "sin."</b> Recognize it for the disobedience, defiance and rebellion it really is.

  An example in II Chronicles 29:6<br>
  <b>b Call sin "forgiven."</b> Christ's work on the cross is wholly sufficient. Romans 8:1<br>

 <b>c Call on God to change you.</b>Repentance is a 180o change in mind - turning from self-effort to
  trusting God to change you. Note-True repentance may require restitution. - Romans 8:6-8</p><hr>

  4. What does God think when you confess for the thousandth time the same sin committed over
again? What does God think when you don’t confess that same sin? What is it that a person is
really saying about Christ’s death on the cross when they come to the conclusion that they have
gone too far in sins committed to be forgiven?<hr>

              Take time to get alone and ask God to show you anything that displeases Him – unconfessed sin or self
              effort. Make a list of everything the Spirit brings to mind. When done, write I John 1:9 across the list.
              Make confession, thank God for His forgiveness, and ask God to change you from the inside out.</b></i>
